# Welcome to Timecode Display

Timecode Display is a small OS X application. We built it to use with [QLab](http://figure53.com/qlab), but it'll work with anything that sends MIDI timecode.

## Requirements

Timecode Display requires Mac OS 10.6.

Building Timecode Display requires XCode. 

## Download

You can download a pre-built copy of Timecode Display here:

## Usage

Timecode Display does only one thing: display MIDI timecode. 

It listens to all incoming MIDI Timecode.  And then displays it.

How many more ways can I try to explain this?
